"""
    This script imports previously-processed dispersion data from one or 
    more source-offsets, bins the data, and computes statistics. The 
    analyst may manually remove data points that correspond to alternate 
    modes, near-field effects, offline noise, or outliers. Post-processed 
    dispersion data will be exported to .pklz and .txt files.
